# my portfolio website
This repository contains the code for my simple two-page portfolio website created using HTML and basic CSS.

Pages
1. Home Page
The home page serves as an introduction, providing an overview of who I am, my skills, and a brief description of the projects I've worked on. It includes links to navigate to the projects page and contact me.

2. Projects Page
The projects page showcases a selection of my notable projects. Each project is displayed with a title, description, and a link to view more details or the project itself.

I welcome any feedback or suggestions! Feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.

Thank you for visiting my protfolio website
